## Projects 4. [Marker Genes for Bipolar Disorder selection using mRMR](https://github.com/vveizhang/Gene-signature-to-predict-bipolar-disorder-from-whole-blood-RNA-seq)

* Build a model to predict bipolar disorders from blood RNA-seq with only 10 features (genes), with 0.91 accuracy score.

* Use grid search to choose the best model from various algorithm including Random Forest, SVM, XGB/Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, Catboost to predict bipolar disorder.

## Projects 6 (Bioinfo) [Essential Genes from Genome-wide Screening as a Resource for Neurological and Mental Disorders Gene Discovery](https://github.com/vveizhang/EG-in-Neuropsychiatric-Disorders)
* By data mining of 6 publicly available case-control RNA sequencing dataset, we found that NEGs are more likely to exhibit differential expression in brain tissue in neuropsychiatric disorders compared to ACEGs.
* WGCNA analysis of human brainspan dataset, we found that NEGs and ACEGs are enriched in different co-expression networks and show different temporal expression patterns.
* GWAS data and rare variants data for neuropsychiatric disorders shows that ACEGs are exclusively enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders, while NEGs are related to neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Projects 7 (Bioinfo) [Hepatitis Viruses affect the expression of Endogenous Retrovirus and Tumor Microenvironment in HCC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.19.496748v1)
* single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to deconvolute the immune landscape and tumor heterogeneity in a cohort of patients with hepatitis virus (HBV, HCV, HDV) associated human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
* Re-analyze the bulk RNA-seq data for the cohort to include the expression values of human Endogenous Retrovirus (hERV), and found correlations with hepatitis virus status.
